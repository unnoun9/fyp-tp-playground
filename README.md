# Formal Verification And Theorem Proving

This repository is a playground for our super amazing and lovely FYP. It contains relevant code, tasks we were given, notes, and other things we encountered in the journey of formal verification, theorem proving, and more...

`efforts_cascade` and `efforts_unnoun` directories contain the relevant code (mostly Lean), tasks, Lean game's progress, and other things done by cascade and unnoun respectively. `notes` directory contains some notes taken by us for the sake of memory or documentation. To read the notes, a markdown reader/renderer is recommended. Clone the repository and just open your preferred markdown reader in that directory. For Obsidian (which we used here), open the *vault* in this *Notes* directory.
